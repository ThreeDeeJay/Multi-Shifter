# Keyboard-H-Shifter
This app was created for Assetto Corsa(and perhaps other sim racing games) to simulate H-Shifter input using keyboard

To use this app you need to install vJoy first (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/)
After installing and opening vJoy, modify the amount of buttons to be more or equal to 9. Now open 'H-Shifter for AC.exe' found in the archive.
Change the vJoy Device in the app to the one which is currently enabled(open vJoy to see which devices are enabled, default is 1).
In the app, you can change the gears to any alphanumerical buttons(A-Z, 0-9 and `, -, =). After choosing preferable settings, press start and go to Assetto Corsa.
Now you can change the controls in AC to keyboard keys.
